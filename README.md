# Invoice Pay

## Overview
This project revolutionizes the lending process by transforming invoices into NFTs, turning real-world assets (RWAs) into digital assets. Borrowers can upload their invoices, which are then minted as NFTs representing their assets, and these NFTs serve as collateral for loans. The system automates the loan process—covering asset deposit, approval, execution, and repayment—through smart contracts, powered by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, ensuring transparency and efficiency in traditional lending.
