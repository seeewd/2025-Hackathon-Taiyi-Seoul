Invoice-Backed Loan NFT System
Overview
This project aims to revolutionize the lending process by converting invoices into NFTs, transforming real-world assets (RWAs) into digital assets. Users (borrowers) can upload invoices, which are then minted as NFTs. These NFTs represent the borrowerâ€™s asset and serve as collateral for loans. The system automates the entire loan process, including asset deposit, loan approval, execution, and repayment, using smart contracts. The entire process is powered by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, bringing transparency and efficiency to traditional lending.
